				<h2>Programming - a Collaborative Process</h2>
				
				<h3>Pair Programming </h3>
				<p>Pair programming can be an incredibly productive tool, but it doesn't come	naturally to everyone (it certainly didn't to me). Going into my first pairing session, I was surprised how nervous I was - Would my coding skills be able to	keep up with my partners? Would I drag down the team? Working as a consultant, I am expected to be an expert in what I do for my clients. It's certainly okay that I don't know everything, but I'm never in a situation where the material is new to me and I have to figure out things on the fly. That sort of uncertainty	plagued me on the way into my first pairing session, but it was quickly alleviated.</p>
				
				<p>What I found when pairing with other students in Phase 0 was an open, non-judgemental culture. My fellow boots and I have all been at similiar experience levels, and have been very willing to share knowlege and help eachother out. Even more, seeing other people's passion for coding has made the experience FUN! We feed off of eachother's motivation and our pairing sessions end up lasting longer than the required/alotted time. Nothing has been frustrating or difficult about the process - it takes a little time to get used to the driver and navigator roles, but I think that will become natural with practice.<p>

				<h3>Feedback</h3>
				<p>Constructive feedback can greatly accelerate the learning process, but it takes work to master. In fact, both giving and receiving feedback can be a stressful undertaking. </p>

				<p>When we receive feedback about ourselves, it's common to focus on the negative aspects and sometimes it's difficult not to take things personally. But it's important to remember that we are here to learn, and a quick feedback loop will help that emmensely. We're all new to web development (especially to pair programming), and no one is expected to be a master at it. As long as we work to incorporate other's specific, actionable suggestions, we will develop into great pair programming partners. The feedback I've received personally has helped a lot - both in enforcing my good habbits, and in correcting some bad ones. I've learned that people appreciate it when you are open and share the resources you've found. I've also learned that when I'm in the driving role, I sometimes over-step my bounds and don't give the navigator enough time to make decisions. This type of feedback was specific, actionable, and kind, and will make a positive impact on my future pairing sessions</p>

				<p>Writing feedback can be even more difficult than receiving it. The first thing that I've noticed is that you need to do feedback quickly! In order to pinpoint productive examples, it really helps that your pairing session is fresh in your mind. The most difficult aspect of giving feedback has been finding constructive things to say. All of my pairing sessions have been great, and often it's been difficult for me to find anything negative about the experience. I've discovered that comments don't always have to be negative to be constructive. Pointing out a specific, actionable thing that someone did well can be just as important as pointing out something that they need to work on. Showing someone that their actions have had a positive influence on you will re-enforce that behavior and encourage them to continue it in future pairing sessions.</p>
