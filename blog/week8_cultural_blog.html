				<h2>Chefs in the Kitchen</h2>
				
				<p>The DBC experience is exactly what I was looking for. I spent the first three years of my career in finance where the "resturaunt attitude" was all anybody knew. I thought about my career in blocks of time - 4 years till I gradute, 2 years till I'm a senior, 5 till manager, 10 till partner. There was very little utility to be had by over-achieving and it resulted in me exploring my passion and creativity elsewhere, outside of work. It wasn't long before I left to find that kitchen attitude but I went out on my own because 1) I didn't really know what I wanted to do and 2) I didn't know anyone else that was willing to take that sort of risk. I've spent the last two years exploring my passions thinking about what I can contribute to the world. I'm excited to be around a group of people that share the same attitude. </p>

				<p>My impression of DBC thus far has been very positive. I knew going into it that the people in my cohort would make or break the experience, and everyone i've met has been intelligent, hard-working and, most of all, excited about learning to code. The pace of phase 0 has been just right - it was challenging and time consuming at first but eventually became very manageable. Not only did it provide a good intro, but it definitely gave me confidence that I won't be drowning on day one at DBC.</p>
				
				<p>This is the ideal type of culture for me. After working by myself for two years, I understand how to guide my own education and am excited to share my experience with others. I love the wholistic approach to learning - not just syntax and cs theory, but empathy and pairing and physical health and industry best practices and all the other nuances that come with programming. I tend to have strong opinions on the world and I haven't agreed with everything I've heard at DBC, but I really appreciate that you guys are starting conversations and are open to everyone's views. If there are people out there that are trying to make their lives and the rest of the world better, I'd team up with them for sure. </p>
