				<p>Without a doubt, the biggest problem facing Tech today is cyber security.</p>

				<p>The rise of the Internet has opened up a whole new realm of possibility for hackers, theifs, and cyber-terrorists. But by some insane phenomenon, the average American doesn't seem too worried. To most, the Internet is a vast and complex thing - we know it can be dangerous, but we don't know enough about it to fully realize the implications. <strong>This is a really big deal.</strong> Last year, in just two acts of cyber crime, hackers stole half-a-billion dollars from a currency exchange and 40 million credit card numbers from one of the country's largest retailers. Leaked NSA documents have shown that when hackers aren't accessing our personal information, the government is. And in March of 2013, multiple weapons systems designs were stolen by Chinese Hackers including the Patriot missile system, the Navy's Aegis ballistic missile defense systems, the F/A-18 fighter jet, the V-22 Osprey, the Black Hawk helicopter and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.</p>

				<p>The truth is, most people don't understand technology well enough to adequatly protect themselves on the Internet. Even for those that do, there exist powerful forces that can break any defense with enough determination. The Tech industry relies on people doing business online, and security is paramount. They need to be concerned with the integrity of their networks, the safety of their users, and the protection of intellectual property - all of which are exposed when conducting business on the Internet. </p>

				<p>There is no easy answer to the problem of cyber security. Security patches and anti-virus programs help, but in the long run there is no better defense than education. Everyone, from a young age, needs to learn how to protect themselves online. The next generation of Americans will live their entire lives connected to the internet and has to have a deeper understanding of technology. Most importantly, Tech can't rely on anyone else to teach them. Our law-makers need to push a formal education reform, but until then, it will be on the Tech industry to educate their customers. They are the only ones with the knowlege, the resources, and the motivation to teach our country how to live safely in a digital world.</p>
