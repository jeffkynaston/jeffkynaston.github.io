				<h2>Resolving Conflicts/h2>
				
				<h3>Background</h3>
				<p>Even for the most amicable of people, conflicts can arise in a professional setting. The University of Oklahoma suggests multiple sources for workplace conflicts, including differing values/interests, scare resources, poor performance, and my favorite - poor communication.</p>
				
				<p>Only rarely do my conflicts escalate to the point of anger, but when they do it's almost always becuase of poor communication. When you're having a discussion with someone, there is nothing more frustrating than when your partner doesn't understand you. In a professional setting, it is very important that both parties understand eachother's goals and motivations. In fact, I had just that type of conflict two years ago.<p>

				<p>I had recently moved to a new town and was referred to a company with an open business development position. Someone I knew was filling in as this company's interim CEO, and he was very insistant on hiring me. I considered the propsal carefully and even did a small project for them, but in the end the job didn't align with my entreprenurial goals. I had moved back home to give myself the time to figure out what I wanted to do and the freedom to work however/whenever I wanted - this position just didn't fit. When I turned down the formal offer, my associate wouldn't take no for an answer. It escalated to yelling and we moved west (the 'attack other' directon) - both of us frustrated becuase we didn't understand the other's point of view. He saw a ton of benefit for me if I took the position - but he didn't understand my motivation. If he did, he would have realized that none of those benefits interested me. By the time I realized I needed to explain that to him, we were already fed up with the issue and had ended the conversation.</p>

				<p>Our lack of communication didn't just blow up this conversation - it was actually the source of all conflict surrounding the event. Progressing to the 'attack other' phase isn't something I do often - but in this case, it was a long time coming. We had been talking for months, and I had gone to countless meetings under the pretext that this position was something it wasn't. I even had multiple discussions about my goals with other members of the company and thought I had made my intentions clear, but that wasn't the case. In the end, I never worked for this company and the project they were interested in hiring me for never came to friution. Perhaps if we had communicated more clearly from the beginning, we would have been able to make it happen.</p>
