				<h2>Value Affirmation and Stereotype Threat</h2>
				<p><div class="green">I have long thought that the point of life was just to be happy.</div></p>

				<p>This means something different for everyone in the world, but it is the one thing that every person instinctually strives for. My relationships with other people are what make me the happiest, and my values from week 1's blog confirm that. Community, close relationships, having a family and helping others are at the top of my list - they are the driving force behind each and every decision that I make.  Other values like courage, ambition, independence, and accountability are character traits that I strive to posess and would like others in my life to posess. The rest (influence, power, pleasure, wealth, etc) are those that I will need in order to achieve and protect my highest values. </p>

				<p>As someone with a growth mindset, I don't think stereotype threat will play into my quest for happiness. The two biggest stereotypes playing against me, right now, are youth and inexperience. Others might be skeptical about the abilities and professionalism of someone that is only 26 years-old. But I understand this disadvantage and will only work harder to compensate for it. I believe that anyone who wants to can make these values a part of their lives, myself included. The trick is to spend time figuring out what <strong>really</strong> makes you happy. Once you understand that, every other decision you make will be clear as day.</p>
