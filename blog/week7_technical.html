				<h2>SQL vs noSQL Databases</h2>

				<p>Traditional SQL databases have been around since the 1980's and have gained widespread popularity. But increases in the types and amount of data that we track have necessitated a new type of database. in the early 2000's, tech giants like Google and Amazon helped to develop a different way for large amounts of data to be organized.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Storage Model</strong><br/>Traditional SQL tables are stored in a grid-like fashion with rows representing entries and columns representing those entries properties. They require each entry in the table to maintain the same properties, and lack flexibility when it comes to updating the types of properties available. noSQL databases, on the other hand, have a number of storage models available. They can store data in key-value pairs or in 'documents' - independent, encapsulated objects of data that can vary in structure from element to element.</p>

				<p><strong>Scalability</strong><br/>SQL databases typically require data to be in the same physical location - on the same server. To increase power and performance, this individual server must be upgraded. However, there is a practical limit to the amount of capital that companies can put into a single piece of machinery. It is much more cost-effective to link the power of multiple systems to gether, rather than to research and develope more advanced machines. noSQL databases are designed to work across multiple servers, so scaling to large amounts of users and data is easier and less expensive.</p>

				<p><strong>Community</strong><br/>SQL has always had a community split between open source and private technologies. noSQL databases, by contrast, are primarily open source. Efficiency and database manipulation tools are typically available for free, provided both by the companies that manage database programs and thid party contributors. </p>

				<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br/>In today's world, there is still a place for both SQL and noSQL databases. The type and complexity of data that you work with will determine the most efficient database to use. Personally, though, I am most excited for noSQL databases. Data is only going to grow larger and more complex as time goes on, so I think it would be best practice to learn the type of database that can handle our modern needs.</p>
