				<h2>Why is JavaScript so Popular in Web Development?</h2>

				<h3>Background</h3>
				<p>In 1995, most of us were watching the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and practicing for our next Little League game. But in the small, burgeoning town of Mountain View a group of developers was working on something that would revolutionize web development. This something was JavaScript, a dynamic programming language developed for both client and server side use. Today, JavaScript is easily one of the web's most popular languages, but what makes it so special? Conventional wisdom would suggest that a 20 year old computer language would, by now, be outdated and replaced by the next big thing. But it remains, to this day, one of the most widely used scripting languages.</p>

				<h3>Speed</h3>
				<p>One of JavaScript's biggest advantages is speed. Many dynamic web languages are strickly server-side - meaning all of the code is executed by the web server, which could be half-way across the world. In constrast, JavaScript code can be interpreted and run locally within a user's broswer, omitting the time that it takes for requests to be sent to and from the server. It can also detect changes that the user makes to a webpage in real-time and alter the content that page displays without re-loading, providing seamless interaction for web applications.</p>

				<h3>Versatility</h3>
				<p>JavaScript also has a distinct advantage in that it can be deployed both client-side AND server-side, producing valuable synergy for developers. Using the same language on both sides ensures compatibility and reduces errors. It also allows developers to focus on learning just one language, instead of switching back and forth between multiple languages that might have completely different syntax and functionality. </p>

				<h3>Inertia</h3>
				Without its merits, JavaScript would have died out long ago. But there is another reason that it has endured so long: inertia. JavaScript is the most widely supported client-side language, making it accessible to more people than any other language. In its infancy, it was supported and pushed forward by some of the biggest names in technology. We see this everywhere in tech. Take the QWERTY keyboard, for example. Other, more efficient keyboard setups exist, but the cost of transitioning an entire generation of people to a different keyboard configuration would be enormous. Is it possible to develop a better scripting language than JS? Yes. Will it happen, one day? Certainly. But for most developers, the wide support of and resources available for JavaScript makes it the best choice out there - for now.</p>
