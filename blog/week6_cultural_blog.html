				<h2>Does stereotype threat really exist?</h2>
				<p><div class="green">Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group<br/><div class="headline-caption"><a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html">Source: reducingstereotypethreat.org</a></div></div></p>

				<p>Stereotype threat has long been used to explain (or partially explain) the undererformance of minority groups. The theory states that calling attention to one's association with a minority group can cause that person to embody the negative stereotypes of that group. To be honest, my initial reaction was, "hogwash". Not only does previous research that we have been exposed to at DBC actually contradict stereotype threat, it all seems (to me, at least) to boil down to a fixed vs growth mindset. In our first engineering empathy video, we were told that we don't always have to agree with DBC's views, but we should be part of the conversation. Since I have such an opposite (and possibly controversial) opinion, I will do my best to be thorough with my analysis, starting with my own experience with stereotype threat. </p>

				<p>Admittedly, I'm not a member of a racial minority in my geographical area, but I have certainly belonged to minority groups in the past. I have always been viewed as a goofy, "class-clown" type of a kid - the type no one would expect to perform well in school. Identifying with this minority group, however, did not cause me to underperform on tests - quite the opposite, in fact. I realized that I enjoyed having that reputation, setting people's expectations low, and seeing the look of suprise on their faces when they realized that I was actually an intelligent person.</p>

				<p>Growing up playing soccer, I was always (until my senior year of highschool) the young kid on the team. In fact, when I was 11 I had to petition my local soccer league to allow me to play in a higher age bracket in order to stay with the team I played for. As the youngest kid, I was expected to be the weaker and slower and underperform compared to older athletes. But quite the opposite happend - competing against older players motivated me and raised the level of my own abilities. </p>

				<p>Another minority group I strongly identified with was as part of a greek fraternal organization. Most people, (my parents and family included) view 'frat guys' as wild, drunk, uninteligent and irresponsible - a whole slew of negative stereotypes. But that wasn't the case at all. Our house's GPA was significantly higher than the average at UCLA. We did more philanthrophy, helped our community and gave back to the school more than average students. In fact, out of the 40 kids I graduated with, nearly everyone is now either a practicing lawyer, a resident physician, or employed in finance. </p>

				<p>Hopefully it makes sense why I don't agree with stereotype threat - my negative stereotypes have motivated and encouraged me throughout my lifetime. I, instead, offer the explanation that stereotype threat is a spinoff of the fixed mindset. Those with a fixed mindset believe that their abilities are innate, so if they belong to a minority group with certain characteristics they will believe they cannot help but embody those characteristics. In contrast, those that approach life with a growth mindset are unaffected by stereotype threat. These people believe that they are capable of enhancing and progressing their abilities, and in turn do not believe that an attirbute such as race or gender or personality or social affiliation will prevent them from achieving their goals. </a></p>

				<p>More evidence directly contradicting stereotype threat is provided by Claudia Mueller and Carol Dweck's reserach into praise. (I'm not making this up, it was on page 185 of "Search Inside Yourself"). These researchers found that children praised for their intelligence actually underperformed on subsequent tests when compared to those which received no praise. In this case, associating students with a minority group that has positive stereotypes actually had a negative affect on performance, the opposite of what stereotype threat would have led us to hypothesize. The best explanation for this contradictory evidence <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat#Criticism">and other criticism of stereotype threat</a> is that performance is actually affected by a person's mindset. Those with a fixed mindset will believe in negative stereotypes about the groups they associate with; those with a growth mind set will not. </p>
