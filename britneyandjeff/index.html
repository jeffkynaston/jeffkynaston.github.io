        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Programming has a reputation for being an individual activity. 
        However, it's becoming more and more collaborative. Many companies use 
        Pair Programming to cut down on errors and shorten development time.

        <h2>What Exactly is Pair Programming?</h2>
        <p>Pair Programming is when two programmers work together on one piece 
        of code at the same time. Typically one person is the driver and the other
        is the navigator. The driver is the person who actually types out the code,
        whereas the Navigator is the person who directs the workflow.

        <h2>Why Pair Programming is Important to DBC</h2>
        <p>Pair programming is important to DBC becuase DBC strives to prepare
        its students for real-world situations. Given the proliferation of pair
        programming in the work force, DBC places and emphasis on practicing
        the skill of pair programming. Not only that, pair programming aids in
        the learning process. It exposes you to different ways of solving
        problems and helps you overcome hurdles more quickly.
