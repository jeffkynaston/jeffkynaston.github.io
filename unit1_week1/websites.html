			<h2>Sound Cloud</h2>

			<p>Sound Cloud is one of my favorite websites because of the content it serves. While other music applications specialize on serving mainstream songs (Spotify), Sound Cloud is a great place to find obscure remixes and original tracks from artists all over the world.</p>

			<p>Once signed into Sound Cloud, users are routed directly to a homepage (soundcloud.com/stream) designed for them to discover, listen to, and share music. The homepage is laid out well, drawing immediate attention to the main content area which features a 'newsfeed' of songs pulled from past listening history and friends' recommendations. Sound Cloud uses the burnt orange color of their logo throughout the page to highlight their most important features, such as the play button for each song. </p>

			<p>This music sharing website employes a number of tools to make their user experience as simple as possible, starting with the gloabl search that is available from any page in the main header. Each song served to users in the newsfeed is accompanied by a robust set of features including sharing, adding to playlists, liking, re-posting, and downloading (if available). This setup allows users to utlize 90% of the site's functionality through one central dashboard. For convinence, a list of the user's favorite songs and suggested artists are available beside the newsfeed, making their homepage the one-stop-shop for all of your Sound Cloud needs.</p> 

			<h2>Whiskey Militia</h2>
			<p>Whiskey Militia is the premier deal-of-the-day website for board sports enthusiasts. In fact, I had to stop visiting the site regularly becuase it was impossible for me to go there without buying something.</p>

			<p>When a user arrives at whiskeymilitia.com, thier focus is immediatly drawn to the current deal, which lasts anywhere from 1 to 15 minutes.
