			<h2>Exercise 2</h2>
			<h4>Explain</h4>
			<p>Two and a half years ago I left my consulting job in San Francisco, moved to Lake Tahoe and spent 6 months figuring out this exact thing. By all accounts I was as happy and well-adjusted as any young professional, but I wanted to undersatnd why I didn't wake up with the same euphoria that I experienced every day in college. After significant deliberation, I discovered that it was because I lacked a sense of community - the feeling that I was part of something bigger than myself. When I was in school, this community was a product of close relationships (a family) that were developed through shared ambition and accomplishments, the desire to help one another, and constant contact (working, living and socializing with the same group, day after day). After Tahoe, I started a company with the sole mission of helping other people and creating that sense of community. Though it's still in its infancy, I hope that one day it grows large enough to re-unite everyone i've ever cared about.</p>

			<h2>Exercise 3</h2>
			<h4>In general, I try to live up to these values:</h4>
			<p>4 - Mostly Agree. Some of these values - Family, Community, Relationships - are important enough to live and die by. (5's) Others - Courage, Will-Power, Wisdom - I respect, admire, and certainly do my best to live up to. (4's) And yet some - Wealth, Power - are not values I strive for specifically, but ones that I understand are a means to an end and an integral part of getting my life where I want it to be. (3's)</p>

			<h2>Exercise 4</h2>
			<h4>What was the last topic someone asked you for advice on?</h4>
			<p>I have experience with the financial and technical aspects of running a small business, so most advice people ask of me is in one of those arenas. I did 6 sets of taxes in 2014 for myself, friends and family. I help businesspeopele around my town with any managmeent accounting questions they have, someimtes turning them into clients, most of the time just because I like to help people. I have also been discussing the opportunity of sharing the knowlege that I gain at DBC/working in Silicone Valley by coming back to my home town and giving regular workshops through the Shasta County Small Business Development Center. </p>
